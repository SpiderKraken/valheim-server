# SpiderKraken's Valheim-Server

Just a simple build on top of [adaliszk/valheim-server](https://github.com/adaliszk/valheim-server) so it could be deployed into a Synology NAS
with the correct User and Group. If you need this for your own, feel free to copy this example and update it with your own user and group ids.
